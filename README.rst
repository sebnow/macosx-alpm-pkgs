Overview
========

This project aims at creating recipes for building pacman packages for
the Macintosh OS X platform. These recipes are called PKGBUILDs and
are plain shell scripts, including metadata and the build()
function. Even if you don't use pacman, or compatible software, you
can still examine the PKGBUILD to build the software manually.
